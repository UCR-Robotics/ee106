Lab 5: ROS Services and Wall Following
====================

Overview
--------

In this lab, we will expand our knowledge of working with ROS by using ROS Services, and we will compare it with the use of ROS Topics in the previous labs. In addition, we will create two new ROS Nodes that will communicate with a ROS Service call, and in the end, we will create a new customized ROS Service type.

ROS Services: Request and Response
----------

As seen in the previous labs, ROS Topics are used to stream data between ROS Nodes to help in their communication and exchange of information to perform a more complex task. ROS Services represent also a way of communication within ROS Nodes, but they are mainly based on request and response interactions. 

Specifically, a ROS Service is described by specific data fields, as a type of a ROS Topic, however, there is a distinction between request and response fields that use different parameters. For example, the `rospy_tutorials/AddTwoInts` is a ROS Service that has been created by ROS Python online tutorials to demonstrate the ROS service request of adding two different numbers. 

.. code-block:: bash

 int64 a
 int64 b
 ---
 int64 sum


Initially, the separation line `--` separates the request and response parameters. In our example, the `int64` ``a`` and `int64` ``b`` are the parameters of the request of the ROS service, that need to be set before the service call. Thus, with the service call, the ROS node that has initialized the ROS Service triggers its function and forms the response variables, which will be returned. On the service caller side, the caller node will get back the output (response) of the ROS Service call and will store it locally to be accessed.
As it is obvious, the request and response variables can be more than one, depending on the used ROS Service.

The ``rosservice`` bash command can be used in the same way as the ``rostopic`` command, to preview further information about the available ROS Services. For example, the argument ``list`` is used to list all the available ROS Services,

.. code-block:: bash

 rosservice list

The `info` argument is used to show information about the selected ROS Service, i.e. `add_two_ints`.

.. code-block:: bash

 rosservice info add_two_ints

To preview the full use of the ``rosservice`` command you can use the ``help`` argument, such as,

.. code-block:: bash

 rosservice help

Notably, the ``rossrv`` bash command is used to display information about ROS Service types, such as,

.. code-block:: bash

 rossrv show rospy_tutorials/AddTwoInts
 

ROS Service Use Example
----------

Let's see an example by using the `rospy_tutorials/AddTwoInts` ROS Service. First, create a new ROS Publisher and Subscriber node, as followed on our `ROS tutorial <https://ucr-robotics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro_ros.html>`_ and name them `node_a.py` and `node_b.py` under the ``ee106s25`` ROS package. In addition, modify both the ``node_a`` and ``node_b`` to the following,


.. code-block:: python  
 :emphasize-lines: 5,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27
 
 #!/usr/bin/env python3

 import rospy
 from std_msgs.msg import String, Header
 from rospy_tutorials.srv import AddTwoInts

 def talker():

    pub = rospy.Publisher('chatter', String, queue_size = 10)
    rate = rospy.Rate(10) # 10hz

 while not rospy.is_shutdown():
    header = Header()
    header.stamp = rospy.Time.now()

    content = "welcome to the Robotics Lab " + str(header.stamp)
    pub.publish(content)

    # Call of the ROS Service 'add_two_ints'
    rospy.wait_for_service('add_two_ints')
    
    add_two_ints = rospy.ServiceProxy('add_two_ints', AddTwoInts)
    try:
        response_msg = add_two_ints(2, 1)
        print(response_msg)
    except rospy.ServiceException as exc:
        print("Service did not process request: " + str(exc))

    rate.sleep()


 if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        rospy.init_node('node_a')
        talker()
    except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
        pass

and the ``node_b``,

.. code-block:: python
 :emphasize-lines: 5,11,12,13,19

 #!/usr/bin/env python3

 import rospy
 from std_msgs.msg import String
 from rospy_tutorials.srv import AddTwoInts

 def callback(data):
    rospy.loginfo(data.data)

 # ROS Service function to be executed when the service is called. The return will provide the response of the service to the caller.
 def add_two_ints(req):
    print(req)
    return (req.a + req.b)
 
 def listener():
    rospy.init_node('node_b')
    rospy.Subscriber('chatter', String, callback)
    # Initialization of the ROS Service
    rospy.Service('add_two_ints', AddTwoInts, add_two_ints)
    rospy.spin()

 if __name__ == '__main__':
    listener()

As it is evident, the highlighted code are new additions in our ROS publisher-subscriber nodes, to integrate the creation (`node_b`) and the call (`node_a`) of the ROS Service.

   .. image:: ./pics/straight_line_wall_following.png
      :align: center

   + \+ 5% Create a new folder in ``ee106s25`` ROS package, by using the name ``worlds``. Download the `Gazebo world <https://github.com/UCR-Robotics/ee106/blob/main/scripts/straight_line.world>`_ and copy it inside the ``ee106s25/worlds/`` folder.
   + \+ 10% Create the below ROS launch file and save it inside the ``ee106s25/launch/``, under the name of ``lab5_turtlebot_world.launch``. Execute the launch file in a separate terminal by running first ``export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger``. 

   .. code-block:: python

      <launch>
      <arg name="model" default="$(env TURTLEBOT3_MODEL)" doc="model type [burger, waffle, waffle_pi]"/>
      <arg name="x_pos" default="0.0"/>
      <arg name="y_pos" default="0.0"/>
      <arg name="z_pos" default="0.0"/>

      <include file="$(find gazebo_ros)/launch/empty_world.launch">
         <arg name="world_name" value="$(find ee106s25)/worlds/straight_line.world"/>
         <arg name="paused" value="false"/>
         <arg name="use_sim_time" value="true"/>
         <arg name="gui" value="true"/>
         <arg name="headless" value="false"/>
         <arg name="debug" value="false"/>
      </include>

      <param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro --inorder $(find turtlebot3_description)/urdf/turtlebot3_$(arg model).urdf.xacro" />

      <node pkg="gazebo_ros" type="spawn_model" name="spawn_urdf" args="-urdf -model turtlebot3_$(arg model) -x $(arg x_pos) -y $(arg y_pos) -z $(arg z_pos) -param robot_description" />
      </launch>

   + \+ 10% Broadcast the static tranformation between the ``base_footprint`` and ``base_scan`` frame, in the similar way with Lab 2. In specific, the ``base_scan`` is located `20cm` above from ``base_footprint`` and is on the same `x` and `y` position, as well as there is no relative rotation. Also, broadcast 2 new ROS frames that will be placed on the left and right body parts of the robot at the same `z` level as the ``base_scan``. Thus, name these two new frames as ``left_limit`` and ``right_limit`` and broadcast them `7cm` left and right of the ``base_scan`` frame. Similarly, in that case, the new frames follow the same orientation of the ``base_scan`` and are placed on the same `x` and `z` levels. Please ensure that the frames are properly placed at the correct positions, by checking also through RViz.
   + \+ 20% Create a ROS Node that will contain a ROS subscriber to the robot's onboard LiDAR module, a ROS publisher on the ``cmd_vel`` ROS Topic of type `Twist`. Include a ROS listener of capturing the transformation of the LiDAR module and the ``left_limit`` frame of the robot.
   + \+ Transform the captured ranging measurements of the left side of the robot (1.52 to 1.62 rad) with respect to the ``left_limit`` frame, calculate their distance from the new origin (0,0) (Euclidian distance, Pythagorean Theorem, etc.), and obtain the minimum distance ``min_dist`` from captured and transformed range measurements.
   + \+ 20% By using that information, develop a navigating behavior of the Turtlebot3 to move ``forward`` if the ``min_dist`` is in `[10,20] cm`, move ``forward`` and ``slightly right`` if ``min_dist`` is less than `10cm` (approaching wall), and move ``forward`` and ``slightly left`` if ``min_dist`` is more than `20cm` (leaving the wall behind). Expand the functionality of this behavior, by adding a check of the front and first range scan (`idx=0`) is less than `30cm`, to detect if the robot reached at the end of the map. 
+ \+ 10% Download the two new Gazebo worlds, namely `complex.world <https://github.com/UCR-Robotics/ee106/blob/main/scripts/complex.world>`_ and `more_complex.world <https://github.com/UCR-Robotics/ee106/blob/main/scripts/more_complex.world>`_ and place them inside the `worlds` folder of ``ee106s25``. Update the `lab5_turtlebot_world.launch` file to load the new worlds, for each experiment. 
 + \+ 15% Fully integrate the left-wall following behavior logic into the TurtleBot3 Burger’s motion-planning node, ensuring it publishes on /cmd_vel for the new complex worlds as well.

 .. image:: ./pics/complex_case.png
      :align: center

 + \+ 10% Record a panoramic video of the resulting left-wall following behavior for each world and include the output of the ROS Node terminal, which will print out the following actions of the robot. Remember that you can always reset the Gazebo world state by pressing ``Ctrl + R`` during your experiments.
 + \- 15%  Penalty applies for each late day.

Left Wall-following Scenario
--------

To perform the left wall following initially, we have to consider the type of sensor modules that the robot will need. In general, there are many types of sensors that can indicate the existence of a wall around the robot, either with physical touch or by distance. In our case, we place a LiDAR sensor on the top of the Turtlebot3 Burger, which provides `360°` range measurements around it. For the left wall-following scenario, we can reduce the captured ranging measurements down to the `front` and `left` side of the robot. In many robots, an ultrasonic ranging sensor is used to provide distances of the front and left side of the robot, but in our case, the LiDAR can provide a range of distance measurements on the front left side of the robot.

The cases that a robot might experience during its exploration in a maze, by following left wall-following, are depicted below,

.. image:: ./pics/wall_following.png
 :width: 600
 :align: center

Initially, as can be seen from the image, every case can be modeled by using two parameters, the `Left Side` and the `Right Side` occupancy. Thus, the robot depending on the values of these two parameters can decide on the next action-move, which can be moving `forward`, `left`, or `right`. These cases can be represented also as the following lookup matrix,


.. list-table:: 
    :align: center
    :widths: 50 50 50
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Left Side
      - Front Side
      - Action
    * - Free
      - Free
      - Left

      - Right

      - Right



   .. + \+ Transform all `non-inf` ranging measurements to all the 3 bumper coordinate systems and form the criticality levels for each of them
   .. + \+ 10% Develop the left wall-following technique. Hint: The robot goes fowrward as long as the distance of the left bumper is within a fixed distance (i.e. 0.3 < r < 0.5). In case the robot gets in a smaller distance than the minimum distance, it has to correct its orientation (clockwise rotation) to continue without colliding. In the same sense, if the robot gets further than the maximum distance, it has perform an anti-clockwise rotation to approach more the following left wall. All that time, you need to check that the robot is not approaching the right wall too, by applying the corresponding actions. In case the robot reaches a spot where front distance is closer than a specific range and the left wall
